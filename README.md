WBAN-OPNET-Simulation
=====================
If you want to use the IEEE 802.15.6 Simulation, please use the [ieee802156](https://github.com/billryan/WBAN-OPNET-Simulation/tree/ieee802156) branch. The master branch is for my own proposal.

WBAN(802.15.6) Simulation based on OPNET 14.5 Modeler for academical purpose.
